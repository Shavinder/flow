Hello, I am Shavinder Dandiwal, licensed as a driver training instructor under the Motor Vehicle Act, BC. I also hold Master degrees in fields of literature and Education and I have several years of experience in college teaching. 

Teaching and instruction skills come naturally to me. I am always eager to help my students achieve their learning targets. My focus is to develop strong foundation of conceptual understanding and then develop on it using dedicated practice.
