Hello, I am Shavinder Dandiwal, an ICBC certified driving instructor. I hold Master degrees in fields of literature and Education. I also have several years of experience in college teaching. 

Teaching and instruction skills come naturally to me. I am always eager to help my students achieve their learning targets. My focus is to develop strong foundation of conceptual understanding and then develop on it using dedicated practice.
