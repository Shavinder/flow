- Scan the intersection for traffic and pedestrians
- Check mirrors, give right signal and shoulder check on the right
- If there is a right turn lane smoothly switch into it
- Stop completely before the stop line approximately 1 meter away from the curb with wheels slightly turned in the direction of the travel.
- Check the traffic coming from the left
- Check for pedestrians crossing directly in thr front.
- When pedestrians are cleared, roll forward inch out at an angle to get a better view. Do not accelrate.
- Keep checking back and right side mirrors for traffic behind.
- Keep an eye on any pedestrian near the corner, they may start to move if light turns green
- Keep on checking the traffic on the left for a safe distance to turn 
- If and when you get a safe distance do a final shoulder check on the right and then start the turn
- Turn along the curve and then recover towards the centre-right
- Speed up to the speed limit
