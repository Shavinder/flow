- Scan the intersection as you approach
- Check the rear-view mirror and right side mirror, give right turn signal, and shoulder check on the right side(especially if there are 2 lanes, including parking lane)
- Steer the car to the right side towards Stop position and gradually slow down
- Completely stop before the stop line or intersection. Your car should be about 1 meter away from the curb on the right side. The wheels/car should be lightly turned towards the direction of travel
- Check left, center and right and then left again for pedestrian, cyclists and traffic
- If the traffic is not visible deep enough, lift the foot off the brake slightly and let the car roll a little forward in the direction of travel. Do not accelerate.
- Check for a safe distance from any traffic coming from left or front turning left
- Before starting check the shoulder on the right
- Turn along the curve and smoothly recover to the center of the lane
