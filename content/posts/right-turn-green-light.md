- Scan the intersection for traffic and pedestrians
- Check mirrors, give a right signal and shoulder check on right
- If there is a right turn lane smoothly switch into it, otherwise keep to the ride side of the lane
- Slow down gradually and approach the turn at a slow speed of around 20 km or less
- Scan on left, center and right 
- If there is any pedestrians in the way, stop at a safe distance before the turn and wait for them to clear the half of the road on your side
- Check for the left turning vehicles from the opposite direction and yield if they start to turn.
- If stopped, check left again and shoulder check on the right.
- Turn right along the curve and then recover towards center right and speed up to the limit
