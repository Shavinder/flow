## Right turn at a stop sign
- Scan the intersection as you approach
- Check the rear-view mirror and right side mirror, give right turn signal, and shoulder check on the right side(especially if there are 2 lanes, including parking lane)
- Steer the car to the right side towards Stop position and gradually slow down
- Completely stop before the stop line or intersection. Your car should be about 1 meter away from the curb on the right side. The wheels/car should be slightly turned towards the direction of travel
- Check left, center and right and then left again for pedestrian, cyclists and traffic
- If the traffic is not visible deep enough, lift the foot off the brake slightly and let the car roll a little forward in the direction of travel. Do not accelerate.
- Check for a safe distance from any traffic coming from left or front turning left
- Before starting check the shoulder on the right
- Turn along the curve and smoothly recover to the center of the lane

## Right turn at a red light
- Scan the intersection as you approach
- Check mirrors, give right signal and shoulder check on the right
- If there is a right turn lane smoothly switch into it
- Stop completely before the stop line approximately 1 meter away from the curb with wheels slightly turned in the direction of the travel.
- Check the traffic coming from the left
- Check for pedestrians crossing directly in the front.
- When pedestrians are cleared, roll forward a little to get a better view. Do not accelrate.
- Keep an eye on any pedestrian near the corner, they may start to move when the light turns green
- Keep on checking the traffic on the left for a safe distance to turn 
- If and when you get a safe distance do a final shoulder check on the right and then start the turn
- Turn along the curve and then recover towards the centre-right
- Speed up to the speed limit

## Right turn on a green light
- Scan the intersection for traffic and pedestrians as you approach
- Check mirrors, give a right signal and shoulder check on right
- If there is a right turn lane smoothly switch into it
- Slow down gradually and approach the turn at a slow speed of around 20 km or less
- Stay approximately 1 meter away from the curb
- Scan on left, center and right 
- If there is any pedestrians in the way, stop at a safe distance before the turn and wait for them to clear the half of the road on your side
- Check for the left turning vehicles from the opposite direction and yield if they start to turn.
- If stopped, check left again and shoulder check on the right.
- Turn right along the curve and then recover towards center right and speed up to the limit

## Right turn on a stale green light
- A green light is stale in these conditions
    - if you did not see it turn green when the intersection is visible to you
    - If the pedestrian crossing light has a hand flashing
    - If there are lot of cars waiting for crossing on the opposite flow
- Cover the brake and prepare to stop if needed as you approach
- Scan mirrors, give turn signal and shoulder check on the right side
- Keep the car towards right side as you approach
- Scan the intersection for pedestrians crossing on the right and the oncoming traffic turning left in the intersection
- Yield to pedestrians and any oncoming vehicle already turning left
- If the way is clear and you are only 4 cars away from the intersection you are past the point of no return
- Maintain the speed, turn along the curve and recover towards the center right of the lane
- While turning stay approximately 1 meter away from the curb
- Speed up and drive towards the center right of the lane
