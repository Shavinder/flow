## Right turn at a stop sign
- Scan the intersection as you approach and do a mirror, signal, shoulder check
- Steer the car to the right side stop position and gradually slow down
- Completely stop before the stop line or intersection keeping approximately 1 meter distance from the curb on the right.
- Aim the wheels towards the direction of travel
- Check left, center and right and then left again for pedestrian, cyclists and traffic
- If the traffic is not visible deep enough, lift the foot off the brake slightly and let the car roll forward **slowly** in the direction of travel. Do not accelerate.
- Check for a safe distance from any traffic coming from left or front turning left
- Before starting do a shoulder check on the right
- Turn along the curve and smoothly recover to the center of the lane

## Right turn at a red light
- Do a mirrors, signal, shoulder check approximately half a block from the turn
- If there is a right turning lane smoothly switch into it after a mirror and shoulder check
- Stop completely before the stop line keeping an approximate distance of 1 meter from the curb on the right. The wheels should be turned in the direction of the lane you are going into
- Check for pedestrians crossing in the front and the traffic coming from the left
- If and when pedestrians clear off, roll forward **slowly** to get a better view of the left side. Do not accelerate.  
- Keep an eye on any pedestrian near the corner, they may start to move when the light turns green
- Keep on checking the traffic on the left for a safe distance to turn 
- If and when you get a safe distance do a final shoulder check on the right and then start the turn
- Turn along the curve and then recover towards the centre-right
- Speed up to the speed limit

## Right turn on a green light

- Mirror, signal, and shoulder check approximately half a block from the turn
- If there is a right turning lane smoothly switch into it after a mirror and shoulder check
- Scan the intersection for traffic and pedestrians as you approach. Watch out for light turning amber. If the light turns amber, stop if you can in a timely and safely manner
- Start slowing down as you approach the turn. 
- Aim for a smooth turning path keeping a distance of 3 feet on the right
- Scan the intersection for pedestrians crossing on the right and the oncoming traffic turning left in the intersection. Yield to any pedestrians and any oncoming vehicle already turning left. 
- Shoulder check right before turning. Keep the speed consistent and smooth at around 20kms/hr
- Halfway through the turn start recovering the steering wheel aiming the car towards the center of the lane. If the lane is wide keep the car approximately feet and a half away from the left side 
- Speed up the car to an appropriate speed


## Right turn on a stale green light
- A green light is stale in these conditions
    - if you did not see it turn green when the intersection is visible to you
    - If the pedestrian crossing light has a hand flashing
    - If there are lot of cars waiting for crossing on the opposite flow

Be prepared to stop. If the light turns amber before you start turning, stop if it can be done safely and in a timely manner.
