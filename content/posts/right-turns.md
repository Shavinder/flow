## Right turn at a stop sign
- Scan the intersection as you approach
- Check the rear-view mirror and right side mirror, give right turn signal, and shoulder check on the right side(especially if there are 2 lanes, including parking lane)
- Steer the car to the right side towards Stop position and gradually slow down
- Completely stop before the stop line or intersection. Your car should be about 1 meter away from the curb on the right side. The wheels/car should be lightly turned towards the direction of travel
- Check left, center and right and then left again for pedestrian, cyclists and traffic
- If the traffic is not visible deep enough, lift the foot off the brake slightly and let the car roll a little forward in the direction of travel. Do not accelerate.
- Check for a safe distance from any traffic coming from left or front turning left
- Before starting check the shoulder on the right
- Turn along the curve and smoothly recover to the center of the lane

## Right turn at a red light

- Stop completely before the stop line approximately 1 meter away from the curb with wheels slightly turned in the direction of the travel.
- Check the traffic coming from the left
- Check for pedestrians crossing directly in thr front.
- When pedestrians are cleared, roll forward inch out at an angle to get a better view. Do not accelrate.
- Keep checking back and right side mirrors for traffic behind.
- Keep an eye on any pedestrian near the corner, they may start to move if light turns green
- Keep on checking the traffic on the left for a safe distance to turn 
- If and when you get a safe distance do a final shoulder check on the right and then start the turn
- Turn along the curve and then recover towards the centre-right
