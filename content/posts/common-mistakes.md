These are some common mistakes, observed after the student has learnt the basics of driving:

- Not being able to steer using the hand over hand technique
- Grabbing the steering too tightly
- Forgetting to steer the wheel back after a turn (recovering)
- Staying too much to the right due to the fear of oncoming traffic
- Drifting the car to the right when preparing to turn left and vice-versa
- Getting dangerously close to the parked cars on the right when focussing on an oncoming vehicle in a tight situation
- Entering a tight space with an oncoming car, instead of stopping and giving way
- Making wide right turns by going straight into the intersection instead of steering along the curvature of the curb
-
