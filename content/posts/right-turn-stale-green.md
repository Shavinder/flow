- A green light is stale in these conditions
    - if you did not see it turn green when the intersection is visible to you
    - If the pedestrian crossing light has a hand flashing
    - If there are lot of cars waiting for crossing on the opposite flow
- Cover the brake and prepare to stop if needed as you approach
- Scan mirrors, give turn signal and shoulder check on the right side
- Keep the car towards right side as you approach
- Scan the intersection for pedestrians crossing and left turn traffic from the opposite side
- Yield to pedestrians and any vehicle already turning left from opposite side
- If the way is clear and you are only 4 cars away from the intersection you are past the point of no return
- Maintain the speed, turn along the curve and recover towards the center right of the lane
- Speed up and acquire the proper lane position
